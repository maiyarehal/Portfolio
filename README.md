# Portfolio
ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Maiya! Welcome to my portfolio, where I showcase my work in data science, business intelligence, and software development. This repository is organized into two main sections:

ðŸ“‚ Internship Projects â€“ Real-world projects from my Data Science & Business Intelligence internship at ECU Health, including Power BI dashboards, data automation, and analytics-driven insights.
ðŸ“‚ Class Projects â€“ A collection of my coursework projects covering machine learning, data visualization, full-stack development, and cloud computing.
What You'll Find Here
âœ… Power BI Dashboards with DAX measures, drill-through functionality, and data warehouse integration
âœ… Data Engineering & Automation using SQL, Python, and ETL Pipelines
âœ… Web Applications & Software Development built with React, Flask, and Java
âœ… Machine Learning & Predictive Analytics using Python, Scikit-learn, and Power BI AI integrations

Each project folder includes a detailed README explaining the objective, technologies used, and key takeaways. Feel free to explore, and if you have any questions, connect with me on LinkedIn or check out my work on GitHub.
