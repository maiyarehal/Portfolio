# **Maiya Rehal | Portfolio**

ðŸ‘‹ **Hello, and welcome to my portfolio!**  
I'm Maiya Rehal, a Computer Science student at East Carolina University, with a strong focus on data analytics, business intelligence, and software development. My passion lies in leveraging data-driven insights, automation, and visualization to enhance decision making and streamline processes.  


## **About Me**  
I began my academic journey at Mississippi State University as a Mechanical Engineering major before transitioning to Computer Science at East Carolina University, where I developed a deep interest in data science, business intelligence, and software engineering. This diverse educational background has equipped me with a unique perspective on problem-solving and system optimization.

During my Data Science & Business Intelligence internship at ECU Health, I worked extensively with Power BI dashboards, data architecture, and data automation, applying analytics to optimize data accessibility and decision making. This portfolio showcases both my internship work and class projects.
